# Hierarchy of Test Suite

At top level of ./tests/ we define the unit and integration tests for our code.

Config Parser unit tests have a subdirectory ./tests/parser\_tests dedicated to
config files used for testing.

Integration tests similarly have a subdirectory ./tests/integration\_testcases
to hold expected server output files.
